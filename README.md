Your installation steps look good, but I'd recommend a small improvement to include the `mvn clean install` command for installing the dependencies. Here's the updated version:

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot-security-jwt-mongodb.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Project Directory

```bash
cd spring-boot-security-jwt-mongodb
```

### Step 3: Build and Install Dependencies

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

or if you are using Windows:

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 5: Access the Application

Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
```

This way, users will ensure that they have all the required dependencies installed before running the application.

This `pom.xml` file defines the dependencies for MongoDB, Spring Security, Validation, Web, and JWT. These dependencies are essential for building a secure Spring Boot application with MongoDB.
